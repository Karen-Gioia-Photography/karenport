## Using Contently

We use contently to manage content:

When uploading Image Assets:

- Use an image that's less than 4MB
- Tag the image with the category if it's going on the homepage
- Use the title and description fields if the image is going on a list page like "Published Work". Description should be the URL you mean to link to.

When setting up a new category / image set:

- Add a tag for it from the settings section (upper right)
- Upload the assets first, then create the new image set
