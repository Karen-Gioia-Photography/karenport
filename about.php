            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I graduated from Columbia College Chicago in May 2012 with a BFA in photography
                and a minor in web development. Before coming to Chicago, I spent three years 
                at Case Western Reserve University and had majored in Computational Biology.

                I have always enjoyed taking pictures, but it was not until 2009 when I started
                thinking of photography as a career.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have very diverse interests, but I am mainly interested in Sports Photography 
                and Photojournalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                I attended the 2012 Sports Shooter Academy IX workshop.

            <p>
                I was born in Buffalo, NY and grew up in the western New York area near Niagara 
                Falls. I moved to Cleveland, OH for the three years I spent at Case Western, 
                and now I have been living in downtown Chicago since 2009.
